            {PROJECT_NAME} is a dev space built for students and developers who
            are eager to code — not just to learn syntax, but to actually
            build things that matter.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            Most students don&apos;t have access to a mentor, a senior dev to
            ask questions, or a space where half-finished projects and messy
            code are welcome. {PROJECT_NAME} exists to fill that gap — a place
            where you can share what you&apos;re working on, get real
            feedback, solve genuine problems, and grow alongside people who
            are figuring it out just like you.

            Why {PROJECT_NAME} exists
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
            Learning to code alone is hard. Tutorials only take you so far,
            and without guidance, it&apos;s easy to feel stuck or unsure if
            you&apos;re even doing things the right way. {PROJECT_NAME} is built
            to change that — by bringing together students and developers who
            want to build in public, ask the questions they&apos;re afraid to
            ask elsewhere, and push each other to keep going.
          </p>

            <li>Real problems worth solving, not just toy exercises</li>

            <li>Room to fail, iterate, and actually get better</li>
